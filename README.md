## Manual Client

In the "Tracker and Locations" tab you'll find buttons corresponding with all the available locations in the Randomizer. Since this is a manual game its built on trustâ„¢ you press the locations when you get to them, hopefully in the future only what you can access will be visible but at the moment you could press victory and it would accept it. Also, if you have death_link enabled, there's a button at the top right to trigger and receive death links.
